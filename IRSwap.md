## IRSwap Example

Imagine a company Russell having AAA credit rating and a company Duan having BBB credit rating.
They will have different loan interest rates due to different credit rating.
Let's say Russell has a fixed IR of 8% and a floating IR of 6%, Duan has a fixed IR of 9% and a floating IR of 6.5%.
It seems like Russell has both of the IR lower than Duan's, but Duan has advantage on floating IR in a way that the difference between fixed IR is 1% while the difference between floating IR is 0.5%.
If Russell wants to loan with floating IR and Duan wants to loan with fixed IR, they are able to save money by performing IR swap with each other.
To be specific, Russell borrows 1 million dollars with fixed IR(8%) and Duan borrows 1 million dollars with floating IR(6.5%).
Then, make Duan pay 2.25% of the IR for Russell, so that Duan is paying totally 6.5% + 2.25% = 8.75% of the IR which is lower than Duan's original fixed IR(9%) while Russell is paying 8% - 2.25% = 5.75% of IR which is also lower than Russell's original floating IR(6%).
Therefore, they have completed an IR swap and saved money for each other.
