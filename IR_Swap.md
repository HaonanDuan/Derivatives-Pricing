## IR Swap Example

Imagine a company Russell having AAA credit rating and a company Duan having BBB credit rating.<br>
They will have different loan interest rates due to different credit rating.<br>
Let's say Russell has a fixed IR of 8% and a floating IR of 6%, Duan has a fixed IR of 9% and a floating IR of 6.5%.<br>
It seems like Russell has both of the IR lower than Duan's, but Duan has advantage on floating IR in a way that the difference between fixed IR is 1% while the difference between floating IR is 0.5%.<br>
If Russell wants to loan with floating IR and Duan wants to loan with fixed IR, they are able to save money by performing IR swap with each other.<br>
To be specific, Russell borrows 1 million dollars with fixed IR(8%) and Duan borrows 1 million dollars with floating IR(6.5%).<br>
Then, make Duan pay 2.25% of the IR for Russell, so that Duan is paying totally 6.5% + 2.25% = 8.75% of the IR which is lower than Duan's original fixed IR(9%) while Russell is paying 8% - 2.25% = 5.75% of IR which is also lower than Russell's original floating IR(6%).<br>
Therefore, they have completed an IR swap and saved money for each other.
